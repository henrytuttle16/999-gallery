story: |
  999 Gallery started the way most good things do—with a group of friends,
  a dream, and a garage that wasn't being used for cars anyway.

  We're a collective of art students who believe that emerging artists
  deserve a space to show their work without the barriers of traditional
  galleries. No commissions, no pretension, no velvet ropes—just art
  and the people who make it.

  Since opening in 2024, we've hosted over a dozen exhibitions featuring
  student artists, recent graduates, and local creatives who are doing
  something different. Our shows range from painting and sculpture to
  video installations, zines, and whatever else fits through the garage door.

  The name? 999 was the address, and it stuck. Plus, it's the angel number
  for endings and new beginnings—which felt right for a space dedicated
  to launching artistic journeys.
